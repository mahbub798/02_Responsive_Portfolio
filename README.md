# 02_Responsive_Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, we will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

## Directions

First, I will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How am I deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Created the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Used Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.git

* Used Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, I should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Checked out various sites on my mobile device vs. my computer to see examples of these differences.

* Used an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

### Requirements met on this project

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
